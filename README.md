# Basic-Calculator

This project is a responsive calculator application developed using HTML, CSS Grid, and Vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates practical implementation of DOM manipulation, event-driven architecture, and structured control flow. The UI is designed using a grid-based layout to maintain consistent alignment and responsiveness across different screen sizes without relying on fixed positioning.

The application includes logic to handle operator validation, prevent consecutive operators, block invalid expression evaluation, and manage post-calculation state using a flag-based approach. Special attention is given to edge case handling, ensuring reliable expression evaluation and predictable user interaction. This project reflects a strong foundation in frontend logic structuring and dynamic UI updates without external libraries.
